We need a class that allows us to encrypt and decrypt information. 
This class will be good for us to have it to incorporate into our projects. 
Typically used to encrypt data in a database and then decrypt it. For example addresses, passwords.

In this C# Class we are going to use the Asp.net System Security Cryptography Assembly. 

For them we need to develop two functions:
- Encrypt Function: It will return the encrypted value
- Decrypt Function: It will return the decrypted value

Strategy to follow to develop the C# Encryption Class:
1.- Create a class called "Encrypter"
2.- Create a function that encrypts the information you provide through two parameters: text to encrypt and encryption phrase
3.- Create a function that decrypts the information it provides through two parameters: text to decrypt and decryption phrase
